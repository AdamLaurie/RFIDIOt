** Bug TODO:   Need to do more to fix with segfault when no readers are found
	added ConnectionAbortedError exceptions if nfc_open returns false
	** This will be a work in progress

NOTE:   temp debug code marked with ## PMS

piped code though expand(1) to get rid of tabs

Ran 2to3 for general concvert

manually reindented

eventually just ran ran black (The uncompromising code formatter) with these options
    [tool.black]
    line-length = 140
    target-version = ["py38", "py39", "py310", "py311"]
    skip-source-first-line = true
    skip-string-normalization = true

ran pylint to spot redefined built-in funtions name used as vars
	(eg: type() use a as a var)

manually updating print formating methods where obvious (more needs doing)

add decode("utf-8")  as needed

Bug: card.errorcode sometimes contained ISO7816ErrorCodes and sometimes libnfc return codes
    added card.get_error_str(card.errorcode) to fix index KeyError runtime exceptions

replace os._exit() with sys.exit()

reordered imports (standard import should be placed before first party import)

removed refs to Deprecated module 'string
